## 🚚 Rebuilding Purpose After Layoffs

Atlanta is feeling the ripple effects of the recent layoffs at **Amazon** and **UPS** — two of the city’s largest logistics employers.  

Behind every headline are real people: hardworking **drivers, dispatchers, and warehouse staff** who kept America moving during the pandemic and are now facing uncertainty.

But what if we could rebuild delivery work — not as a gig hustle, but as a **transparent, purpose-driven economy**?

## 💡 Enter @DELIV3RY: The Web5 Pilot Changing the Game

**@DELIV3RY** is a purpose-based delivery platform powered by **What3Words geolocation** and **TikTok Proof-of-Delivery (POD) videos**.  

Each delivery is verified, timestamped, and rewarded **on-chain**, creating a transparent digital receipt that restores **trust, transparency, and dignity** to the driver experience.

### Here’s how it works:
1️⃣ **Drivers capture** an 11-second TikTok video at the What3Words drop-off spot.  
2️⃣ The clip becomes a **tokenized Proof of Delivery (POD)** minted as a **LUV NFT**.  
3️⃣ **Businesses reuse** the content for marketing while **drivers earn Bitcoin L$VE rewards** based on community upvotes and credibility scores.

> It’s not just delivery — it’s **delivery with purpose.**

With support from **ATL Airport**, **Georgia’s Transit Trust Fund**, and local nonprofits, we can pilot **@DELIV3RY** as a **hybrid mobility + workforce innovation project**.

### Every verified delivery creates:

## 💖 Web5: Where Work Meets Purpose

This isn’t the gig economy — it’s the **purpose economy**.  
Instead of draining energy through profit-first platforms, we’re creating a **donation-first, community-backed model** that rewards **real people**, not bots or middlemen.

### Our vision:
> “Every delivery becomes a story of trust, transparency, and human connection.”

Through TikTok-powered transparency, blockchain accountability, and local collaboration, we’re building the next evolution of fair, transparent work.
