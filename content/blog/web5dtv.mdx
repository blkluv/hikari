## 🌐 A New Era of the Internet Has Begun

We’re entering an age where **value flows with attention** — and where **payments happen as effortlessly as streaming a video**.

Everyone knows *HTTP 404 — Not Found.*  
But few realize there’s also *HTTP 402 — Payment Required* — a code reserved decades ago for the future of online payments.  

That future has now arrived.

## 💡 What x402 Means for the New Digital Economy

The **x402 payment standard** enables autonomous, on-demand payments to occur *within the web itself*.  
No subscriptions, no logins, no paywalls.  
Value exchange becomes a native heartbeat between **data and dollars**.

Imagine watching a stream, reading a post, or accessing an API — and paying only for the seconds you use.  
No middlemen. No friction. No cookies or cards.

This technology doesn’t just fix how we pay online — it redefines the **balance of energy, attention, and value** across the entire digital ecosystem.

## 🎥 Introducing WEB5DTV — The Streaming Layer of the Open Payment Web

**WEB5DTV** is the spiritual and technological evolution of television — a decentralized **Pay-Per-View (PPV)** network that uses the x402 standard to synchronize two essential flows:

🌀 **The flow of content**  
💸 **The flow of payments**

> When the money flows, the stream flows.  
> When it stops, access pauses — automatically, respectfully, and transparently.

Currently running on **Solana Devnet**, WEB5DTV lets anyone experiment with **pay-per-second** or **pay-per-view** access — learning how on-chain micropayments and HTTP negotiation interact in real time.

Once testing is complete, the system transitions to **mainnet deployment**, powering real-world monetization across Web5-native video ecosystems.

## 🧠 Why WEB5DTV Is Different

Unlike algorithmic networks that profit from outrage and distraction, **WEB5DTV is built with vibrational integrity**.

Access to both streaming and content creation is **invite-only through HAHZ.LIVE subscribers**, who are verified not just for content quality — but for **energetic resonance**.

We’re ensuring this network never becomes another digital echo chamber of chaos.  
Every contributor, viewer, and host aligns around one principle:

> **“Transmit light, not chaos.”**

By curating both **frequency and flow**, WEB5DTV merges **technical decentralization** with **spiritual governance** — preserving a media environment that is healthy, conscious, and creative.

## ⚙️ Built on x402 — Powered by Solana

Deployed on **Solana Devnet**, WEB5DTV uses the **Flow402x** specification to showcase real-time, pay-per-use streaming.

This open standard allows developers and creators to embed **autonomous payment negotiation** directly into their platforms — letting audiences **fund each moment** without subscriptions or corporate intermediaries.

The protocol’s SDK and token adapters support multiple networks including **Base** and **Solana**, with future expansion for **AI agents**, **IPFS**, and **Arweave** content storage.
