## 🎬 The Future of Video Is Peer-to-Peer

I built a **Bitcoin-powered YouTube alternative** that lets creators earn **Bitcoin tips (“Zaps”) directly on their videos** — no ads, no platforms taking a cut, no middlemen.  

It’s called **NFTV**, a decentralized, censorship-resistant video network powered by the **Nostr protocol** — the same open standard that’s transforming Bitcoin social media.

## ⚡ What Makes NFTV Different

Unlike traditional video platforms, NFTV doesn’t rely on centralized servers or algorithms. Instead, it uses **Nostr**, a distributed communication protocol that connects users directly.

### Core Features:
- 🧠 **Decentralized Login:** Your account lives on Nostr — not in a database.  
- 🪙 **Bitcoin Zaps:** Viewers send Bitcoin tips instantly via the Lightning Network.  
- 🎞️ **Censorship Resistance:** Videos are stored across distributed storage nodes.  
- 💬 **Threaded Comments:** Comment, reply, and react — all on-chain and verified.  
- 🕶️ **Privacy-First:** No tracking, cookies, or shadowbans.  
- 📱 **Works Everywhere:** Mobile, tablet, or desktop — no app store required.

> NFTV empowers creators to own their content, their audience, and their income — directly, transparently, and globally.

## 🧭 Getting Started with Nostr (For Beginners)

Before you can post or receive Bitcoin tips on NFTV, you’ll need a **Nostr account**.  
Here’s the step-by-step guide to getting started:

### Step 1: Create a Nostr Account
1️⃣ Visit [https://snort.social](https://snort.social) or [https://iris.to](https://iris.to)  
2️⃣ Click **“Create Account”**  
3️⃣ You’ll receive two keys:
   - **Public Key (npub...)** — your username  
   - **Private Key (nsec...)** — your password (keep it safe, never share it)

You now officially have a decentralized identity — your Nostr profile.

---

### Step 2: Connect a Lightning Wallet
To receive **Bitcoin Zaps**, you’ll need a Lightning wallet connected to your Nostr profile.

Recommended options:
- ⚡ **Alby:** Browser extension wallet with Nostr integration → [https://getalby.com](https://getalby.com)  
- ⚡ **Wallet of Satoshi:** Easy mobile wallet for sending and receiving tips  
- ⚡ **Zeus or Phoenix:** Advanced Lightning wallets for full node users  

Once your wallet is ready, copy your **LNURL** or **Lightning Address** (looks like an email, e.g. `you@getalby.com`).

---

### Step 3: Add Your Lightning Address to Nostr
1️⃣ Go back to your Nostr profile (Snort or Iris)  
2️⃣ Edit your profile  
3️⃣ Paste your **Lightning Address** under the “⚡ Lightning Tips” section  

Now your account is ready to receive Zaps (Bitcoin microtips) anytime someone likes your video or post.

---

### Step 4: Log In to NFTV
1️⃣ Go to [https://nftv.hahz.live](https://nftv.hahz.live)  
2️⃣ Click **“Login with Nostr”** (NIP-07 supported browser or extension required)  
3️⃣ Upload your first video or clip  
4️⃣ Add a title, tags, and optional thumbnail  

That’s it — your video is now part of the open Bitcoin video network.  
Viewers can send **Zaps directly** to your Nostr Lightning address, instantly and globally.

---

## ⚡ How Bitcoin Zaps Work

When someone enjoys your video, they can “Zap” it — which sends you a **real Bitcoin micropayment** via the Lightning Network.

### Example:
- A fan clicks ⚡ “Zap”  
- 1,000 sats (≈ $0.50) instantly transfers to your wallet  
- The transaction is recorded on Nostr as a **Zap Receipt (Kind 9735)**  

Every tip is peer-to-peer. No platform fees. No waiting periods. Just **direct digital gratitude**.
