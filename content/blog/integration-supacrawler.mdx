When you start a SaaS app using **Hikari**—Next.js 14 + Supabase + Stripe + Tailwind—you get a strong foundation: authentication, subscription billing, dashboards, docs/blog support, UI scaffolding.

But often, you’ll also want to bring in external content, monitor page changes, or extract structured data from other sites. That’s where [**Supacrawler**](https://supacrawler.com) becomes a natural companion.

Below is how Supacrawler adds value to Hikari-based projects, some use-cases, what implementing it looks like, and why this combo works well.

## What Supacrawler Brings to the Table

Here are the capabilities Supacrawler provides that Hikari doesn't include out of the box:

- Extracting and transforming content from external sources (blogs, documentation) via REST API endpoints like `/scrape` and `/crawl`.  
- Full-page screenshots and previews (with JS rendering) using `/screenshots`.  
- Monitoring external pages for updates using `/watch` — useful for changelogs, compliance, or competitive tracking.  
- Affordable and performant crawling jobs with asynchronous processing, backed by Redis + Asynq. Supacrawler documentation confirms its focus on cost-effectiveness and stability.

## Example Workflows When You Combine Hikari + Supacrawler

These are practical scenarios showing how developers using Hikari could plug in Supacrawler to extend their app:

| Workflow | How Supacrawler Is Used | Why It Helps |
|---|---|---|
| **Content Imports** | Use the `/crawl` endpoint to harvest external blog or docs content, convert it to Markdown/JSON, and integrate into Hikari’s blog or knowledge sections. | Lets you aggregate content without manually copying/pasting, or writing scraping logic. Keeps content up-to-date automatically. |
| **Change Alerts & Monitoring** | For pages that matter (competitor pricing, external docs, regulatory sites), schedule `/watch` jobs; then show flagged changes in dashboards or send email/webhooks. | Great for SaaS apps that need real-world signals or timely updates. Reactive rather than manual. |
| **Visual Previews / Archiving** | When users supply URLs to display content previews (e.g. link previews, snapshots), use `/screenshots`. | Improves UI / UX; gives a visual way to confirm content, not just text. |
| **Data-Driven Features** | Build features like content search, enrichment (extract metadata, links, images) using `/scrape` and `/crawl`. For example, combining scraped documentation with your own content search powered by Supabase + vector embeddings. | Adds value-added features (search, recommendation) without heavy scraping infrastructure. |

## How to Integrate Supacrawler with Hikari

Here’s a mental sketch of how you’d wire them up:

1. **API Key / Service Setup**  
   Deploy or use Supacrawler (locally or hosted), get API key, set environment variables in your Hikari project to point to Supacrawler endpoints (e.g., `SUPACRAWLER_API_URL`, `SUPACRAWLER_KEY`).

2. **Create Utility Modules**  
   In Hikari, write small service modules (JS/TypeScript) that call Supacrawler’s `/scrape`, `/crawl`, etc. Maybe utilities like `fetchExternalBlogContent()`, `watchPageDifferences()`, `generatePreviewScreenshot()`.

3. **UI / Backend Hooks**  
   - Backend server side (Next.js API routes) to process the Supacrawler jobs, handle responses.  
   - Frontend UI components to display previews, show status of monitoring, or content fetched.  
   - Use dashboards in Hikari to show external content, maybe with filters or schedule.

4. **Configuration Choices**  
   - Depth of crawl, link limits, and whether JS rendering is needed (these affect performance).  
   - How frequently to watch pages.  
   - Storage of screenshots / scraped content (store in Supabase Storage or other storage).  
   - Error handling & retries.

To showcase Supacrawler in real-world workflows, here are some tutorials I’ve published:

* [Production-Ready RAG with Supacrawler and pgvector](https://supacrawler.com/blog/production-ready-rag-with-supacrawler-and-pgvector)
* [Automate Monitoring Website Changes with Watch](https://supacrawler.com/blog/automate-monitoring-website-changes-with-watch)
* [How to Crawl Blogs and Docs](https://supacrawler.com/blog/how-to-crawl-blogs-and-docs)
* [Github](https://github.com/supacrawler/supacrawler)

These examples highlight how Supacrawler can be used to **build AI-ready pipelines, monitor critical web pages, and retrieve structured content at scale**.
